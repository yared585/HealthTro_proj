# HealthTro_proj

for the project i have used Maven spring starter project with the required dependencies. 
i have connected the endpoint using RestTemplete and accessed the website url, then i was able to sort and manipulate the data. 
to sort the data i immplemented comparator since we are comparing user defined objects. to flter by period or year i have used java 8 
feature stream and filted the data. 


To test and see the output make sure you test it using browser or postman using the api "http://localhost:8080/Api"  

after running the project in eclipse 
got to  "http://localhost:8080/Api"   using get method see the output
